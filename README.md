  > I was disappointed to discover, when I tried to migrate my playlists to Tidal, that the free versions of both recommended transfer apps have 250-song restrictionsâ€“and the paid versions are subscription apps. Given a choice, I'd rather not enroll in a monthly subscription to a (likely) single-use app.

  > Credit mainly to Brittany Chiang, whose recent newline.co course Build a Spotify Connect App (free online at the moment) is a concise masterclass in best practices for REST API client-building. (And whose code and architecture I'll be replicating as much as possible.)
  >
  > The two main modifications we'll be making to Brittany's code will be 1. adapting the OAuth flow to use Remix's routing and 2. orchestrating the multiple API calls for user info with StepZen rather than Axios (and focusing our query on Liked Songs.)
